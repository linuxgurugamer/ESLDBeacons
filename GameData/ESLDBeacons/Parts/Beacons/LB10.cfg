	description = Developed to simplify in-system transfers, the LB-10 detonates crystalline Karborundum to rip a small hole in space-time.  Ships can then (potentially) pass through the breach and (hopefully) emerge (mostly) intact at another beacon.  That's the theory, anyway.  The LB-10 is optimized for distances of under 1 gigameter, but is okay with a wide range of weights.
